# Bayesian-Inference
 fixed.py - performs sampling for a hierarchical model with fixed birth delays.
 
 fnorm.py - performs sampling for a model with distributed birth delays. The delay hyperpriors are set as informative folded normal distributions.
 
 mdip.py - performs sampling for a model with distributed birth delays. The delay hyperpriors are set as uninformative Maximum Data Information Prior (MDIP).
 
 nonhier_dist - nonhierarchical counterpart of mdip.py
 
 nonhier_fixed - nonhierarchical counterpart of fixed.py
 
 pooled_nonhier_dist - nonhierarchical counterpart of mdip.py but with pooling of data
