# Bayesian-Inference
This is a collection of tools for doing bayesian inference on parameters of the chemical reaction 0-> X -> 0
with birth parameter A and death parameter B.
Contents:
1. ssa.ipynb performs stochastic simulation algorithm
2. MH.ipynb performs metropolis hasting algorithm on a fully observed system
3. simple block update.ipynb does Bayesian inference on a partially observed system through the block updating method.
